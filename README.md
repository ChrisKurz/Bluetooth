# Bluetooth LE

In this repository you will find several step-by-step hands-on descriptions showing how to use the Nordic Semiconductor Bluetooth Stack included in the _nRF Connect SDK_. 

All hands-on exercises are based on _nRF Connect SDK_ v2.3.0. 

Here is a list of available hands-on exercises:

## Beacon

- [iBeacon](doc/NCSv2.3.0_01_Beacon.md) - initialize bluetooth stack and realize a broadcaster (creating project from scratch)

## Using Bluetooth Services (Bluetooth defined services and custom services)

- [BLE Peripheral with Device Information Service](doc/NCSv2.3.0_02_peripheral_Service_DeviceInformation.md) - allow to establish a connection. Example uses GATT Service, which is available within NCS (Device Information Service).

## Bluetooth Stack Feature Settings

- [Using 2M-PHY](doc/NCSv2.3.0_06_peripheral_2MPHY.md) - requesting 2M-PHY usage.
